				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>Formally, i go by Steve Aboll. I am 21 years old, as of the date of publishing 6th May 2025.</p>
				<p>I'm passionate about Cybersecurity, low level programming, Network security. Along side all this I also value building simple websites just for the hustle- It's a perfect mix for both technicality and creativity.</p>
				<p>I believe in keeping things simple yet powerful, with the principle <strong>"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication!"</strong></p>
				<p>I'm commited to staying a life long student in this field with a focus on building deep skills, and NEVER chasing shortcuts. When I'm not tackling BCOM coursework, you'll find me tinkering with <strong>linux internals</strong>, <strong>programming in C</strong>, Or <strong>deepening my understanding on how computers work!</strong></p>
				<p>Good work takes time, and I'm looking forward to how the journey unfolds step by step!</p>

				<h2>Passions and Interests</h2>
				<p>My primary passion lies in cybersecurity, where I aim to build secure systems and networks, keeping them resilient as possible from evolving threats. I also find deep fascination in low level programming particularly, C as it gives me understanding of underlining systems and how they work. I'm also interested with network security and keeping the digital world safe.</p>
				<p>I love solving problems and constantly challenging myself to get better. I like learning new things, simplifying complicated ideas, and communicating them clearly. In my free time, I enjoy tinkering and learning, always pushing myself to grow</p>
				<p>I also build simple websites as a hobby to improve my technical skills. Itâ€™s a fun way to mix creativity and problem-solving. I plan to keep developing these skills while working toward my career in Cybersecurity.</p>
